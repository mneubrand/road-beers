Since first hearing about the John Muir Trail from the Movie "Mile, mile and a half" we wanted to do the trail ourselves. With a year of travel coming up we finally
had the time to embark on this epic 200+ mile hike and cross this item of our bucket list.

# Day 1 - Tuolomne Meadows to Lyell Fork Bridge
*9.7 miles*

We had a very late start today. After spending our last night in civilization at Halfdome Village we took a bus for 2.5 hours to reach our trailhead at Lyell Canyon.
If we had to do it again we'd probably spend an extra night at the backpacker campground at Tuolomne Meadows. It'd make for an earlier start and your body would have
more time to adjust to the altitude.

When we finally started around 11 am we were hungry already though we didn't want to waste any more time and decided to hike at least a few miles before a lunch break.
The trail was pretty flat but the heavy pack and altitude made it feel like we were walking uphill the entire time. After lunch we felt better for a while. Every food
break also meant that we'd no longer have to carry that food which made it even better. Around 3.30 pm we reached Lyell Fork and took a break. From there it was only
1.2 miles and 600 ft elevation gain to our goal for the day. Those 1.2 miles really ended up kicking Markus' butt. Heavy pack and the altitude really got to him and
he had to take a lot of breaks on the way up. At least the views overlooking Lyell Canyon were spectacular which made those breaks much more pleasant.

Once we arrived at the Lyell Fork Bridge most camping spots were already taken. We had to settle for one very close to the creek. The NPS range that gave us our wilderness
permit the day before really drilled into us that we have to camp at least 100 ft away from water and our current spot is close to exactly that distance from it. We're a
little paranoid we'll get in trouble but hopefully it all works out. Tomorrow we'll start off with a big climb. Hopefully we'll be better adjusted already.

# Day 2 - Lyell Fork Bridge to Thousand Island Lake
*10 miles*

Markus is writing this on day 3 because he passed out from exhaustion before he got to this yesterday. Before we went to bed on day 1 we ran into a ranger camping next to us
that confirmed that our camping spot was legal which eased our paranoia. She also took some trash that Megan found near our site which was nice because it meant we didn't have
to carry it all the way to Red's Meadow.

We started hiking at 8.20 am and made good progress initially. The ascent to Donohue Pass (11060 ft) is broken up into 3 steep sections. We felt pretty good for the first two but Markus
had a hard time on the last one and needed to take a lot of breaks again. He was also passed by Dave, a 68 year old Australian, that we'd run into on and off again almost the
rest of the trail.

After the pass things were supposed to be easy for the rest of the day but the descent from it was painful as well. It felt like it took forever to reach the bottom of Island Pass
despite it only being 3.8 miles. Island Pass (10200 ft) is not even 600 ft elevation gain but with a empty gas tank at the end of the day it dragged on forever. So did the roughly 2 miles
after the pass to get to Thousand Island Lake junction. Unfortunately camping isn't allowed near the inlet so we had to walk another half a mile along the shore to find a camping spot.

We almost settled for a pretty crappy spot near the trail when another backpacker that had gotten lost on the way back to his spot pointed us to a real nice spot at higher ground with a
spectacular view over the lake. We nicknamed him the "Campsite Fairy". It took 8 hours to hike 10 miles today and Markus passed out with a headache. At least we'll be able to enjoy
the great view tomorrow morning.

# Day 3 - Thousand Island Lake to Rosalie Lake
*8.2 miles*

The day started with a gorgeous sunrise over Thousand Island Lake. We broke camp pretty quick and hit the trail shortly before 8 am. It seems like we're getting better at the whole
routine. Unfortunately Megan didn't feel very well so we took it very slowly. At least it wasn't a very long day.

We made it to Garnet Lake pretty quickly which was just as beautiful
as Thousand Island Lake. We hit Shadow Lake Junction around 11.30 am and ran into Linda there. Linda is 67 and from Healdsburg and doing the entire JMT in 42 days. She's also carrying
a 4 pound floating device for this section to float around in some lakes! We talked for a bit and shared lunch before we started the final climb of the day to Rosalie Lake. Megan felt
better again so Markus was again the one trailing behind on the climb.

We found a nice camp spot near Rosalie Lake around 1.30 pm. Pretty short day that left some time to relax and nap
before dinner. Dinner was amazing. We brought some Bettie Crocker Brownie Mix and made something that resembled hot chocolate with it. Tasted great!

# Day 4 - Rosalie Lake to Red's Meadow
*8 miles*

Definitely our easiest day yet. Only a little uphill climp in the morning followed by almost 8 miles of slow descent into Red's Meadow. On the way there we passed by Devil's Postpile
which was swarming with day hikers. Devil's Postpile itself was not really impressive. We reached the campground at noon did laundry, had a shower and had some beers and cheeseburgers.
Might as well as this is the last chance until the end.

The next few days should all be pretty easy but the hard passes after Muir Trail Ranch are getting closer and make us a bit nervous. In the evening we had a bottle of wine and sat
around benches on the campground with other backpackers and exchanged stories. We went to bed at 9.30 which is the longest we've made it so far and actually saw the night sky for once.
Linda was supposed to make it to Red's today as well but she didn't show up. We hope she's OK and went straight to take a shuttle to Mammoth Lakes instead and got a massage like she
wanted to.

# Day 5 - Red's Meadow to Purple Lake
*13.8 miles*

We picked up our resupply bucket at Red's in the morning after we had breakfast in the little cafe there. Delicious food we didn't have to cook ourselves and no dishes to do.
Surprisingly we fit most of the food and only left behind a handful of items.

The beginning of the trail out of Red's goes through a burned area which offers great views. Originally we only wanted to go to Deer Creek today but the hike their went smooth
and we were already there by noon so we decided to go further after a lunch break. There is no water between Deer Creek and the next junction for Duck Lake so we knew we had to make
it there. It'd be another 1000 ft elevation gain after we already did 1000 ft before noon. Things went surprisingly well though and there were some spectacular vistas on the way.
Just the last section over some uneven rocks was a little bothersome. We also ran into some people we camped with at Red's last night including a couple from Las Vegas that plans to
do the while JMT in only 12 days!

At the Duck Lake junction we still felt pretty good and decided to go for another 2.3 miles to Purple Lake. That turned out to be a huge mistake. The steep switchbacks in the beginning
of that section took all our energy and we were completely drained when we finally arrived at Purple Lake at 5 pm. Megan had a migraine and laid down immediately after we put the tent
up. She didn't even want to eat dinner but a cup of nacho cheese we picked up this morning convinced her otherwise. In the end we crawled into our sleeping bags at 6.30 pm already and
passed out.

# Day 6 - Purple Lake to Lake Virginia
*1.7 miles*

Considering that at this point we were 2 days ahead of our planned schedule and beat up from yesterday we decided to take it easy today. We only hiked the short distance to Lake Virginia
and found a nice and secluded camp spot further down the shore. The reset of the day we spent relaxing, napping and reading. Originally we planned on a lot of swimming as well but the lake
was so cold that we couldn't stand it for more than a minute. Lake Virginia was a beautiful sport for a rest day. Great views and plenty of wildlife to watch. Markus was especially fond of
some small rodents that behaved and looked similar to prairie dogs. According to our guide book they're Belding's ground squirrels.

# Day 7 - Lake Virginia to Mott Lake Junction
*10.7 miles*

We started early at around 8 am so we'd reach Silver Pass before the sun is too strong. The day began with a very short uphill section followed by a long descent to Tully Hole and along Fish
Creek. We got a little nervous because the way down seemed pretty long and we knew we had to climp the same amount back up on the other side. In the beginning of the ascent to Squaw Lake we
ran into 2 guys that started at the same spot we did 2 days later and overtook us. They said they hike until sunset every day and looked pretty banged up. Doesn't sound enjoyable at all.
Also ran into some deer that wasn't scared of us at all and just stood in the middle of the trail 20 ft away from us.

We reached Squaw Lake shortly before noon and had lunch there. The last 500 ft climb over Silver Pass (10740 ft) were pretty rough because the sun was at its highest and the trail was completely
exposed. The views from the top were spectacular and another hiker took a photo of us there to commemorate our wedding anniversary. The first few miles of descnet were pretty though as well as
there was little shade. After a final series of steep switchbacks we finally reached our destination for today and found a nice little camp spot across Mono Creek.  Our wedding anniversary
dinner was a complete disaster. The pasta burned and the hot chocolate brownie mix didn't get creamy because we forgot to add oil.

# Day 8 - Mott Lake Junction to Bear Creek Junction
*9.6 miles*

Got off to a late start and only reached the Lake Edison Junction around 10 am. Markus also pissed off some chipmunks when he used the bathroom this morning. They ran circles aroudn him and
yelled. He probably wrecked their living room. From the Lake Edison Junction the mindnumbing 2000 ft climb over Bear Ridge began via seemingly endless switchbacks. We almost made it to the
top by noon and had lunch. Ironically the last 2.3 miles from Bear Ridge to Bear Creek felt the worst despite being downhill. We finally reached our camp spot around 2.30 pm and spent the rest
of the afternoon doing laundry and soaking in ice cold Bear Creek. Only 13 miles to Muir Trail Ranch from here. Depending how we feel tomorrow we'll either push over Selden Pass or camp
slightly before it.

# Day 9 - Bear Creek Junction to Sallie Keyes Lake
*8.8 miles*

Today went pretty well. We made it to Marie Lake shortly after noon despite a late start. From there Selden Pass is only 350 ft elevation gain more so we decided to have lunch and push on to
Sallie Keyes Lake. Markus felt like his right hip was bruised the entire time but it turned out it was just a pimple in the exact spot the waist belt of his pack sits. Bad luck. The views
from Selden Pass (10900 ft) were great and we made it to our camp spot in the foreset along Sallie Keyes Lake by 2.30 pm. In the late afternoon two girls pitched up tents just 50 ft from us without
saying a word to us and despite hundreds of other possible spots nearby. A bit annoying but I guess we better get used to it as people will cramp up together near Muir Trail Ranch and near
the approaches to the big passes that are coming soon.

# Day 10 - Sallie Keyes Lake to Muir Trail Ranch
*5.3 miles*

Another easy day. Just 5 miles and all downhill. We arrived at the campground near Muir Trail Ranch around 11 am, put up tent and headed back to MTR to check out the amenities and use the
internet. While we were there other hikers talked about how great their stay at MTR was and unfortunately Megan overheard that there was still a cabin available. On the way back to our
campsite we had a major fight until Markus finally had to vie in and walked back to book the cabin. The amenities were great considering that we're in the middle of nowhere: showers, toilets,
hot spring, dinner and breakfast included. Though the price tag of $330 for it is pretty rough. But they're pretty much a monopoly out here so they can chacrge whatever they want.

# Day 11 - Muir Trail Ranch to Evolution Creek
*8.1 miles*

Spending a night in a real bed instead of our tent wasn't as relaxing as we hoped but the amazing breakfast burritos made up for that. After breakfast we spent our time until 10 am checkout by
using all the amenities one last time. We picked up our resupply bucket and started on the tedious task of squeezing 10 days worth of food into our bear canister. Now that we've had some more
experience organizing the canister it went much better than last time but we still ended up donating some things to the hikers bucket.

We left MTR around noon and on the way out the old rancher there warned us that he had a feeling we'd get rained on. Turns out he was right and it started raining around 2. Fortunately it
wasn't very strong or long. We sheltered under some trees for the worst of it and then just pushed through. Megan luckily picked up a rain poncho that she thought was a bag from the MTR
hiker buckets that fit over her and her pack. Markus covered his with a trash bag. Also had a fight about how Markus was too cheap to buy proper rain covers for the bags. Hopefully it will
be sunny from here on out. We made it to camp near Evolution Creek around 5. The last climb up to it with the full resupply on our back sucked but at least we won't have to start with it
tomorrow.

# Day 12 - Evolution Creek to Evolution Lake
*6.9 miles*

We had an early start because it was freezing last night and we didn't sleep well. There was still frost on the ground in the morning. We ran into a lot of deer on our way through Evolution
Valley and started our final climb for the day to Evolution Lake around 10.30 am. We found a little camp spot that somebody had built a little stone wall around overlooking stunning Evolution
Lake. The view and landscape around the lake is amazing but unfortunately it is also pretty windy. Hopefully our little stone fortress is enough shelter

# Day 13 - Evolution Lake to Bishop Pass Junction
*13.4 miles*

Last night was one of the coldest so far and we both had a hard time getting some rest. We made breakfast with gloves on and started our ascent towards Muir Pass (11980 ft) around 8 am.
The first few miles through Evolution Basin went by pretty quickly and we slowly started to warm up. Soon we could see the hut on top of Muir Pass on the horizon. That turned out to be
pretty misleading as it still took us quite a long time to finally reach it. Especially the final stretch in the high altitude was exhausting but the view from the top made it worth it.

The first few miles of the descent were tough as well and the rocky terrain took a toll on us. During lunch a curious chipmunk was circling us the entire time hoping he could snatch some
food. Soon after lunch the view over Le Conte canyon opened up and the net few miles were full of amazing scenery. We also found the Le Conte Canyon monster and took some pictures with it.
Around 4 we almost settled for a pretty crappy campspot but luckily we decided to push on and found a great spot. It's been a long day but it will make the Golden Staircase tomorrow and
subsequently Mather Pass much easier.

# Day 14 - Bishop Pass Junction to Lower Palisade Lake
*10.4 miles*

Thanks to the lower elevation it wasn't quite as cold last night. The goal of today was to get into a good position for Mather Pass. Ideally we'd make it past the Golden Staircase. In the
morning we had a good pace thanks to the fairly flat trail and made it to Deer Meadow around 11.30 am. Unfortunately we didn't realize that we had reached it and when we wanted to stop for
lunch we were already slightly up the Golden Staircase. That caused a fight because Markus hates eating in the sun. Right after lunch we found a horseshoe on the trail that we decided to
take with us as a souvenir for Megan's mom. Not exactly the most lightweight thing we could possibly pick out but a nice find. After some food we were in a better mood and started
the climb. By the way Golden Staircase is a terrible name for the place. Neverending Staircase from Hell would be much more appropriate. The climb took forever and the constant large steps
made it hard to find a rhythm. We put up tent at Lower Palisade Lake around 2.30 pm. Still early enough to do some cleaning and laundry.

# Day 15 - Lower Palisade Lake to Tahoose Pass Junction
*11.0 miles*

We slept in pretty late and only started our ascent up Mather Pass (12100 ft) around 9 am. In the beginning it looked like we'd make it there in no time but it turned out to be a false summit
with another climb waiting for us behind it. We finally made it to the top aroudn 11 am. The south side of Mather Pass looked like a landscape from another planet that we'd need to cross
through. According to our map the South Fork Kings River crossing should only be 5.6 miles away but it felt like it took forever. We also ran into other hikers whose maps showed 6 or 7 miles.
Very frustrating. We reached the bottom of the valley around 2.30 and decided to push on towards the Bench Lake junction to make Pinchot Pass tomorrow easier. A climb at the end of an day
always sucks and in the end we had to push to almost Lake Marjorie to find an open campsite. At least it is nice and secluded and has views back into the valley and Mather Pass in the distance.

# Day 16 - Tahoose Pass Junction to Woods Creek Junction
*10.1 miles*

Last night was freezing and we had ice in our water bottles in the morning. The morning routine dragged along very slowly until the sun finally hit our campsite. The climb up Pinchot Pass
(12130 ft) was pretty easy and we ran into some familiar faces, Sarah, Dave, Dan and Karen, on top of it that we haven't seen since Muir Trail Ranch. The south side of the pass looked similar
to Mather Pass and we again had to cross a barren landscape before reaching and descending alongside Woods Creek. The whole descent was steep, rocky and unpleasant and it took a long time to
cover the 7.4 miles to the Woods Creek junction. Later we found out that the original trail went closer to the creek but was rerouted to protect the vegetation there. Slowly the trail is taking
a physical toll on us now. Chaffing and other pains are getting worse but we'll have to push through them.

# Day 17 - Woods Creek Junction to Upper Rae Lakes
*6.5 miles*

Today was a pretty short day. Despite a late start and walking slowly to avoid aggrevating the chaffing we made it to camp at 1pm. We also checked in with a ranger station for a weather
forecast. It's supposed to be warmer and no rain the next days so hopefully we'll be good for the rest of the trail. Dan and Karen also had some extra Vaseline they gave us which should
fix our chaffing issues. From Rae Lake we're in a nice position to tackle Glen Pass tomorrow. We did some laundry in the afternoon and saw a coyote sneak around our campsite. Unfortunately
we didn't manage to get a picture.

# Day 18 - Upper Rae Lakes to Vidette Meadow
*6.6 miles*

We woke up to an amazing sunrise over Rae Lakes. Unfortunately the campground got pretty crowded overnight so finding a secluded spot to dig a cat hole was tricky. The climb up Glen Pass
(11970 ft) was steep but short and we reached the top by 10 am. Glen Pass itself is amazing. It's just a small little strip on top of a mountain ridge. The way down went by pretty quick as
well and despite a lunch break we reached camp around 1 pm. We accidentally picked a camp spot in Lower Vidette Meadow instead of Upper Vidette Meadow but that one mile shouldn't make much
of a difference. Shortly before we planned on having dinner we had a bear in our campsite. We already had our food bag out of the canister and turned our back to look at the nearby
creek for a second. When we turned around he had already snuck up real close to the dinner bag. After we yelled at him he slowly trotted away like a dog that got in trouble. The whole
experience certainly made us be extra diligent with food storage that night. Tomorrow the long climb up Forester Pass awaits.

# Day 19 - Vidette Meadow to Lake South America Junction
*12.3 miles*

We started the day pretty early and began the long ascent up to Forester Pass (13110 ft). Though it is a lot of elevation gain the entire trail climbs very gradually. We didn't even notice that we
passed Center Basin Creek and soon found ourselves above the treeline. Around noon we reached the Lake at 12.200 ft which was were we originally wanted to camp. Because it was still early
and only 900 ft elevation gain and a mile more to go we decided to push on. The last few switchbacks wre rough and it was hard to catch ones breath because of the altitude. Just like Mather or
Pinchot Pass we could see the trail go south for miles through barren landscape before reaching trees again. It was a pretty hot day and that section dragged on forever while we were baking in
the sun. At least we ran into a couple of marmots on the way down which cheered us up a bit. Around 4 we reached a large campsite near the Lake South America Junction and decided to call it a
day. After sunset we could hear a pack of coyotes howl nearby before we went to bed.

# Day 20 - Lake South America Junction to Crabtree Meadows
*8.9 miles*

We saw some dark clouds yesterday late afternoon and were worried about the weather so we got off to an early start. On Bighorn Plateau we saw a coyote in the distance at a lake but unfortunately
no actual bighorn sheep. We made it to Crabtree Meadows Ranger Station around noon to get a weather forecast. The ranger said that there is potential for thunderstorms this afternoon but it
should be clear the next days. We decided to put up camp near the station so we wouldn't get caught by rain in the afternoon and did some laundry. Shortly afterwards it started to rain and we had
to huddle up in our tent with all our belongings. This is one of the time were we are glad that we brought our cheap and bulky tent instead of some fancy backpacker tent. It is bad enough to be
trapped in ours let alone one were you could barely turn around in. When the rain got a little lighter we quickly had dinner outside in rain coats and got back into the tent as quickly as we
could afterwards

# Day 21 - Crabtree Meadows to above Guitar Lake
*3.4 miles*

We woke up to a clear sky, hung our wet cloth back up outside and went back to bed. We had no dry cloth to hike in so there was no point in waking up early. While our cloth were drying we relaxed
and read around our camp spot and only started hiking shortly before noon. It didn't even take 2 hours to reach our campspot for the night above Guitar Lake. The short hike felt surprisingly
hard like our bodies are slowly having enough of this. In the afternoon dark clouds returned as well giving us some dramatic views from our campsite. One last climb tomorrow and all downhill
from there.

# Day 22 - Above Guitar Lake to Outpost Camp
*10.7 miles*

What a day to get over Mount Whitney (14505 ft). The wind got much worse over night and we both got little to no sleep because it constantly felt like our tent will be blown away. After some especially
strong gusts in the early morning ew decided to pack up and start the day. It was too cold and windy to make breakfast and all our water was frozen. When Megan tried to use the wag bag inside
the tent it almost blew over again. We packed up everything as quickly as we could and started our final ascent freezing and with constant wind gusts.

When we finally reached the junction to Whitney Portal and the summit we weren't sure if we should even try to summit in these conditions but in the end we decided to go for it. We left our
bags and hiking sticks at the junction, grabbed 2 still half frozen water bottles and started the trail up to the summit. At least some sections of the summit trail were in the sun by now which
helped a little. The trail goes along some pretty steep cliffs which combined with all the wind gusts was quite scary at times. We reached the shelter at the summit at 10 and immediately went
inside of it to get out of the wind without even enjoying any of the views. Markus had a hard time signing our names in the summit register because his hands were so clam. We ate a frozen power bar inside the shelter and then decided to start our descent. It was too cold
to take a lot of pictures but the view in all directions and down the drops was spectacular. The few photos Markus took he triggered with his nose because he didn't want to take his hands out
of his gloves.

On the way back down a seemingly endless stream of day hikers passed by us. They all moved really slowly and looked beat up and getting out of their way delayed our descent quite
a bit. From the junction where we left our packs behind it's only a couple hundred feet to Trail Crest (13670 ft), the highest and last pass of the JMT. The weather on the south side of the pass
was much better and we finally felt like the worst was behind us. It still took quite a while before we finally warmed up. We had lunch at Trail Camp but because it was still pretty windy
we decided to push on and camp at Outpost Camp. Outpost Camp is below the tree line and we didn't want to risk another terrible night almost being blown off the mountain. We reached our last
campsite of the trip around 3 pm. It was a little bittersweet but the weather today was bad enough that both of us are looking forward to finishing tomorrow. Only 3.8 miles to Whitney Portal
left.

Later on we found out that the National Weather Service had issued a weather warning for that day with wind gusts of up to 55 mph.

# Day 23 - Outpost Camp to Whitney Portal
*3.8 miles*

It was another awfully cold morning but knowing that we were almost done made it more bearable. We packed up all our belongings and rushed down towards Whitney Portal. Those last 3.8 miles
went by real quick. We made it to the Whitney Portal shortly after 10 am and finished our hike. The little cafe at the portal was still serving breakfast at this point but our heart was set
on burgers and beer so we waited until 11 am to get them. Best meal we ever had and the sixpack we had helped pass the time until Megan's parents picked us up.
