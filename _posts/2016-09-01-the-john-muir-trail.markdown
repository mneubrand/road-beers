Our friends had a car so we didn't have to worry about transportation this time. The parking lot is very small and was already full. Park rangers were intercepting cars before they could reach
the parking lot and directing people to park on the side of the road. This is a great way to prevent the traffic chaos that would otherwise happen if people realize that the lot is full and have
to turn around on the narrow road leading to the parking lot. There are some restrooms at the parking lot however there is no water.

The first few miles are following the coast line and offer nice ocean views. After that the trail turns inland and passes two little lakes: Bass Lake and Pelican Lake.
