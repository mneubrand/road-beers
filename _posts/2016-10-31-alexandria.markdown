The last leg of our US road trip ended outside Washington, DC in Alexandria, VA. We stayed with our friends Damaris and Mark. Steph and Brandon also joined us from Detroit. It was a mini
"friends reunion" as we were missing a link--Kristina we missed you!

As this was Halloween weekend we kept it festive with a trip to Georgetown, DC where we walked down the steps from the
film the Exorcist--spooky! We also went on a ghost tour of Historic Alexandria (I recommend doing this with some alcohol in your system). Later in the evening we went to a speakeasy called
[Captain Gregory’s](https://captaingregorys.com/). The vibe here was really neat as you entered the bar through a closed donut shop, once inside the cocktails were also top-notch--we all
went bananas over the Piña colada. The next day we went to the National Museum of American History and ended the day with a movie night in. As we won’t be in the US for the holidays we combined
a few of them in one night: we watched scary movies while drinking homemade eggnog made by Steph--delicious!

The end of our US trip is bittersweet. Seeing so many friends and family located in different places was a reminder that no matter where we are, we’ll always have people somewhere, anywhere,
there for us. I’ve been hung up on the decision to travel and relocate away from the Bay Area, spending time with friends and family throughout this journey has put me at ease.
