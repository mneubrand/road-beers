We spent 2 more weeks in Xela taking Spanish lessons and doing small trips in its surroundings. Afterwards we headed to Antigua to begin our trip through the rest of Guatemala and Central America.

# Xela

Our apartment in Xela is modest, but contains everything we need, we paid 280 USD for three weeks. We had a few issues the first week with our shower, also known as a
[Suicide Shower or Widow Maker](http://johnnyvagabond.com/travel-tips/survive-suicide-shower/). Originally we had no hot water (which if you read the article, may have been for the better) and
began our morning routine with boiling water to shower with. We recently had it fixed and now receive lukewarm water, which we’re happy with. Also, so far, Markus is the only one to have suffered
an electric shock. Megan continues to say a little prayer before each shower.

We first arrived in Xela during Día de Todos los Santos and went to the cemetery to absorb the atmosphere. It was wonderful to see all of the families celebrating their loved ones who have passed.
Most families meticulously cleaned and decorated their graves, they then would gather to eat and drink around the grave and kids were flying kites. It was a truly festive occasion.

We have also traveled to the nearby city of Salcajá--home to the first church built in Central America. Getting there was a bit of an adventure as it was our first time riding the notorious
[chicken bus](http://www.amusingplanet.com/2012/10/chicken-buses-of-guatemala.html). There were no seats, so we stood in the back and held on for dear life. How many people can fit in a
chicken bus? Always one more.

On the weekend we visited [Fuentes Georginas](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/guatemala/western-highlands/fuentes-georginas/introduction), natural thermal springs near Xela. We went on a lazy Saturday
afternoon, when the sky was cloudy and the air was cold, making it an extra relaxing afternoon. On Sunday we visited El Baúl a forested hill on the outskirts of the city overlooking Xela.
