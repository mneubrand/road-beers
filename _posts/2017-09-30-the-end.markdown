After spending some time with Markus' family and friends in Austria and a trip to Greece with Markus' parents our journey has come to an end for now.

In our year of travel we stayed in over 100 different accommodations in over 30 countries and travelled via bus, car, train, ship and plane. For
now our journey has come to an end and we're back in the U.S. and excited to be moving to Chicago soon.
